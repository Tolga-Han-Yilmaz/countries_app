    - I developed the application with ReactJS,
    - I pulled the data from api with axios,
    - I listed all countries in the table by flag, name, capital and region,
    - There are 2 options in the search section,
    - The first is the search to cover all the data in the api,
    - The second is the search by capital of the countries,
    - I used Bootstrap for design.
